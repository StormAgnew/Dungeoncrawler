    //Orcs are bloodthirsty creatures with realitively low Karma. A nice orc is a rare orc. They're frowned upon by all races.

    //Humans are boring.

    //Elves are friendly creatures that have incredibly high karma. They are very caring and go out of their way to help others, sometimes even orcs... Only to get stabbed in the back for being naive.

    //Dragonlings are half human, half dragon. They are giant humans, with wings sprouting from their backs. They have horns imbedded in their foreheads, and their shape and size depends on the personality of the Dragonling.

    //Ravenir are Raven-humanoid beings. They have wings with fingers that fully function much like a humans. They are shady creatures, and are frowned upon by the humans. The humans are borderline, if not fully, racist to them.
